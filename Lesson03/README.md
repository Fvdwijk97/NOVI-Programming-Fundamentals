LESSON 3: CONDITIONAL LOGIC & LOOPS IN PRACTICE

Overview
This lesson focused on practicing 'if' statements and 'while' loops though small interactive programs. You combined 
logic, repetition and input validation to build practical applications.

Learning Goals
- Apply conditional logic with if/elif/else
- Use 'while' loops for repeated actions
- Validate user input
- Combine logic, loops and calculations in small programs

Key Concepts

Conditional Logic (if/elif/else):
- Multi-branch decisions
- Nested conditions
- Input validation before calculations

Loops (while):
- Repeating actions until a condition is met
- Using counters and break conditions
- Interactive loops based on user input

Practical Assignments
- Calculator: with input validation
- Pizza Order App: with size, extras and price calculation
- Change Calculator: using iterative substraction
- Password Checker: with three attemps
- Random Number Guessing Game: with hints and succes message
