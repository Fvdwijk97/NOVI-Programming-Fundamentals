Lesson 1: Variables, print, input & Operators

Overview
This lesson introduces the foundational building blocks of Python programming. 
You explored how Python handles arithmetic operations, comparison logic, user input, and basic data types such as 
strings and booleans. These concepts form the core of writing simple, interactive programs.

Learning Goals
- Understand and apply Python's arithmetic operators
- Work with strings & booleans
- Use comparison operators to evaluate expressions
- Accept and process user input
- Combine operators and data types in small programs

Key Concepts

Arithmetic Operators: 
+ addition
- subtraction
* multiplication 
/ division 
% modulo (remainder)
// floor division (integer division)
And the order in which they are performed.

Comparison Operators:
== equal to
!= not equal to
> greater than
< less than
>= greater than or equal to
<= less than or equal to

Data Types:
- Strings; text values, e.g., "Hello"
- Booleans: True or False
- Integers/Floats: numeric values used in calculations

User Input:
- Using input() to receive text from the user
- Converting input to numbers using int() or float()
