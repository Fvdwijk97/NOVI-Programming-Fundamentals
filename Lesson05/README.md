# Lesson 5: Dictionaries, Sets, Functions (intro) & Libraries

### Overview
This lesson introduced Python collections like dictionaries and sets, basic function concepts, and how to use libraries
to extend functionality.

### Learning Goals:
- Understand dictionaries & sets and their use cases
- Learn how to define and call functions
- Explore built-in, standard and external libraries and how to install them.

### Key Concepts

#### Dictionaries:
- Store data as key-value pairs
- Keys must be unique and immutable
- Common operations

#### Sets:
- Unordered collection of unique elements
- Useful for removing duplicates
- Mathematical operations: union, intersection, (symmetric)difference, etc

#### Functions (intro):
- Define reusable blocks of code with def
- Accept parameters and return values
- Improve code readability 

#### Libraries
- Build-in libraries; included in Python
- Standard libraries; usable after import <library name>
- External libraries (PyPI); install via (python -m) pip install <library name>
