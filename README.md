About This Course

This module introduces the foundational principles of programming and helps you develop the mindset needed to think like 
a programmer. You learn how to break problems down, structure logic, and design simple solutions — essential skills for
building useful applications and understanding how software works.

What I Learned

Throughout this module, I worked in an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and experimented with various example 
programs. I learned how to:
- write simple scripts
- automate repetitive tasks
- work with variables, operators, conditionals, and loops
- build small interactive applications
- structure logic in a clear and maintainable way
These fundamentals form the basis for more advanced programming and data engineering skills.
