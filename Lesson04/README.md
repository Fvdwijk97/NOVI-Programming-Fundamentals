LESSON 4: WORKING WITH LOOPS, TUPLES & LISTS

Overview
This lesson focused on Python's sequence types and iterative structures. You practiced using 'for' loops to process 
collections, worked with tuples and lists, and explored how to store and manipulate multiple values in a structured way.

Learning Goals:
- Use 'for' loops to iterate over sequences
- Understand the differences between tuples and lists
- Create, update and access list elements
- Apply loops and lists together to build small interactive programs

Key Concepts

For loops:
- Iterating over lists, tuples and ranges
- Processing each element in a sequence
- Using loop variables effectively

Tuples:
- Immutable sequences
- Useful for fixed collections of values

Lists:
- Mutable sequences
- Adding, removing and updating items
- Storing dynamic collections of data

Custom Mini-Project
You created a small shopping-list program that;
- Started with an empty list
- Repeatedly asked the user for product names and quantities
- Stopped when the user indicated they were finished
- Printed a complete shopping list at the end
