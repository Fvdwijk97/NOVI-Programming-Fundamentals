Lesson 2: Control Structures - Conditional Logic & Loops

Overview
This lesson introduced Python's core control structures. You practiced writing conditional logic with if/elif/else 
statements, and used 'while' and 'for' loops to repeat actions and build interactive programs.

Learning Goals
- Write conditional logic using if/elif/else statements
- Use 'while' and 'for' loops
- Validate user input 
- Combine control structures in small applications

Key Concepts

Conditional Statements:
- Multi-branch decisions
- Nested conditionals
- Input validation before processing

Loops:
- 'while' loops for repeated execution
- 'for' loops for iterating over sequences
- Using break and continue

Mini-Game Assignment:
You created a small game that included;
- At least three layers of logic
- A loop to keep the game running or to repeat actions
- Proper input validation
